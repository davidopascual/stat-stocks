# üö® IMPORTANT: Supabase Setup Required

## Issue Detected

Your server is configured to use Supabase, but the database tables haven't been created yet. This is why you're getting `fetch failed` errors when trying to register users.

## ‚úÖ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `aoyzungbezkavabxfdtp`
3. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Database Schema

1. Copy the entire contents of this file: `/server/supabase-schema.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)

This will create all necessary tables:
- ‚úÖ `users` - User accounts and portfolios
- ‚úÖ `positions` - Stock positions (long/short)
- ‚úÖ `transactions` - Trade history
- ‚úÖ `leagues` - League information
- ‚úÖ `option_positions` - Options trading positions
- ‚úÖ `leaderboard_entries` - League leaderboards

### Step 3: Verify Tables Were Created

In Supabase, go to **Table Editor** and verify you see these tables:
- users
- positions  
- transactions
- leagues
- option_positions
- leaderboard_entries

### Step 4: Test Authentication

Once the tables are created, test registration again:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "testuser",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'
```

You should get a success response with a user object and JWT token!

## Alternative: Already Set Up Tables?

If you've already created the tables and are still getting errors, the issue might be:

### 1. Network/Firewall Issues
Try testing the Supabase connection directly:

```bash
cd /Users/davidpascualjr/Desktop/statstocks/server
node -e "
const { createClient } = require('@supabase/supabase-js');
const client = createClient(
  'https://aoyzungbezkavabxfdtp.supabase.co',
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImFveXp1bmdiZXprYXZhYnhmZHRwIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3MzAzMTQ4ODUsImV4cCI6MjA0NTg5MDg4NX0.qYH9kQJ1KfN8K8tFLTqDJXY3YbNqGqMsQQTmJJ2zRCo'
);
client.from('users').select('*').limit(1).then(r => console.log('‚úÖ Supabase connection works!', r.data)).catch(e => console.error('‚ùå Connection failed:', e.message));
"
```

### 2. RLS Policies
If tables exist but queries fail, you might need to disable Row Level Security (RLS) for testing:

In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
```sql
-- Temporarily disable RLS for testing (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!)
ALTER TABLE users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE positions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE transactions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE leagues DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE option_positions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: In production, you should enable RLS and create proper policies. For now, this will let you test the app.

### 3. CORS Issues
Make sure your Supabase project allows requests from localhost. Check:
- Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API ‚Üí CORS

## What Happens After Setup?

Once the database is set up, your app will have:

‚úÖ **Persistent User Accounts**
- Users can register and login
- All data saved permanently in PostgreSQL
- Never loses progress on server restart

‚úÖ **Portfolio Tracking**
- All stock positions saved
- Transaction history preserved
- Portfolio value calculated in real-time

‚úÖ **League Functionality**
- Create and join leagues
- Leaderboards with real data
- League settings and restrictions

‚úÖ **Production Ready**
- Scales automatically with Supabase
- Secure authentication with bcrypt + JWT
- Fast indexed queries

---

## Next Steps After Database Setup

1. ‚úÖ Test user registration
2. ‚úÖ Test login (email and username)
3. ‚úÖ Test creating a league
4. Update frontend to use new auth system
5. Migrate remaining endpoints to Supabase
6. Full end-to-end testing
7. Deploy before NBA season! üèÄ

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues after running the schema:

1. Check Supabase logs in Dashboard ‚Üí Logs
2. Verify your API keys are correct in `.env`
3. Make sure tables were created successfully
4. Test the connection with the script above
5. Check if RLS is blocking queries

The authentication system is **fully implemented and ready** - you just need to set up the database tables!
