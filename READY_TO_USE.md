## 💾 Data Storage

### Current Setup (Working NOW)
- **In-Memory Storage**: All data is stored while servers run
- **Session Persistence**: Logins persist in browser
- **Works Immediately**: No database setup needed

### Future Setup (Optional - For Persistent Data)
- **Supabase Integration**: Already coded, just needs activation
- **Instructions**: See `server/RECOVERY_GUIDE.md`
- **Schema Ready**: `server/supabase-schema-final.sql`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
./stop-servers.sh  # Stop all servers
./start-app.sh     # Restart
```

### Login Issues
- Works without Supabase setup
- Data persists while servers run
- Restart servers = fresh start

### Can't Connect
- Check backend is running on port 3001
- Check frontend is running on port 5173
- Look at logs in `logs/` directory

### Clear Everything
```bash
./stop-servers.sh
rm -rf logs/
./start-app.sh
```

## 📊 Current Limitations

### Temporary (While Servers Run)
- User accounts persist
- Trading history saved
- Portfolios tracked
- Leagues maintained

### On Server Restart
- All data resets
- Users need to re-register
- Portfolios start fresh

### To Make Permanent
- Apply Supabase schema
- Update `.env` with real Supabase key
- See `RECOVERY_GUIDE.md` for instructions
