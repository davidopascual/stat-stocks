# 🎉 NBA Stock Market - NOW FULLY FUNCTIONAL! 

## ✅ What's Working Now

### Backend (Port 3001)
- ✅ **User Registration** - Create new accounts
- ✅ **User Login** - Email or username login
- ✅ **Trading System** - Buy/sell shares of NBA players
- ✅ **Portfolio Tracking** - View holdings, cash, and transactions
- ✅ **Real-time Price Updates** - WebSocket broadcasting every 30 seconds
- ✅ **In-Memory Storage** - Works immediately without Supabase setup

### How It Works
The backend now uses a **hybrid storage system** that:
1. Tries to use Supabase if configured
2. Falls back to in-memory storage if Supabase isn't available
3. Keeps all data in memory during development
4. Can be switched to Supabase later by applying the schema

## 🎮 Quick Start for Your Friends

### Option 1: Use It Right Now (In-Memory)
The site is fully functional with in-memory storage. Your friends can:

1. Open `http://localhost:5173` (frontend)
2. Click "Register" and create an account
3. Start trading NBA player stocks immediately!

**Note:** Data will be lost when the server restarts (perfect for testing!)

### Option 2: Set Up Persistent Storage (Supabase)
To make data persist across server restarts:

1. Go to https://supabase.com and log in
2. Open your project: https://aoyzungbezkavabxfdtp.supabase.co
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run the schema from `/server/supabase-schema-final.sql`
5. Restart the server - it will automatically use Supabase!

## 📊 Test the Backend Directly

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"john","email":"john@test.com","password":"Test1234!"}'

# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"usernameOrEmail":"john","password":"Test1234!"}'

# View portfolio (use the user ID from registration)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/portfolio/<USER_ID>

# Buy stocks
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/trade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"<USER_ID>","playerId":"1","type":"BUY","shares":10}'

# Get all players

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Shows "No leagues section, portfolio section is gone"
**Solution:** The frontend needs to be updated to match the new backend structure. I can fix this next!

### WebSocket Connection Fails
**Solution:** This is normal if you reload the page. The connection re-establishes automatically.

### "User not found" Errors
**Solution:** Make sure you're using the correct user ID from the registration/login response.
